/*
Write a SQL query to get the second highest salary from the Employee table.

+----+--------+
| Id | Salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
For example, given the above Employee table, the query should return 200 as the second highest salary. If there is no second highest salary, then the query should return null.

+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| 200                 |
+---------------------+
*/

Solution:

A. Using SubQuery
SELECT max(salary) as SecondHighestSalary
FROM Employee
WHERE salary < (SELECT max(salary) as SecondHighestSalary
                FROM Employee);
                
B. Using Window Function
With CTE as
(SELECT salary, DENSE_Rank() OVER(order by Salary desc) as drnk
FROM Employee)

SELECT salary as SecondHighestSalary
FROM CTE
WHERE drnk =2;
